# CT Tumor Classification
This repository is written with Python. It holds the code for my 2022 Synopsys Project.

## Description
The best accuracy achieved by the CNN model is 99%. The aim of this model is to be able to classify brain tumors in CT brain scans with the same accuracy as CNN models based on MRIs can achieve. CT scans take less time than MRIs, are more accessible, and less expensive. More importantly, MRIs pose a threat to patients who have metal implants while CT scans do not. With a MRI, even patients who wear dental braces or metal dentures may be subject to a distorted brain MRI.

## Running Code
To run the program, open the terminal and type
```
python3 main.py
